# My technology and engineering learning journal


### TODO:

- orchestrate a better workflow than this for local development:
  - connect-deps is promising
  - currently need to run yarn pack --> then run yarn add path to tar.gz
  - package.json has a relative path to the theme:
    ./../../base_gatsby_blog_github_theme/gatsby-theme-replica/gatsby-theme-replica/gatsby-theme-replica-v0.0.1.tgz
  

+ publish with a better name: **_gatsby-theme-github-replica_**

  
### Credits

- theme: [updated version of gatsby-theme-replica](https://github.com/sanyamsmulay/gatsby-theme-replica)
  - yet to be published, but latest
  - fork of: [gatsby-theme-replica](https://github.com/sabrinaluo/gatsby-theme-replica)
    - the original is 3 years old now with no change
    - I suggest that people start with my version
